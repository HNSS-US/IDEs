#### Linux Installation

I am about to write something that I never thought I would never write. Not in my lifetime or in the N^(N+1) lifetimes of my children. Here goes, I just installed a Microsoft Product on my Linux computer with the following commands:

0x24 sudo apt-get update  
0x24 sudo apt-get upgrade  
0x24 sudo apt-get install snapd  
0x24 sudo snap install code --classic  
0x24 sudo apt-get update  
0x24 sudo apt-get upgrade   

(The multiple update and upgrade are my habit.)

To uninstall: $ sudo snap remove code

Also, depending on your distro and version, it could be available in the Software Center.

As amazing as the installation experience was, what is more, amazing is that I love using this application. All I can say is good riddance to Bill Gates! And may he and his kind never return to the world of computers.
